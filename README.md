## Introduction  
This repository contains scripts for the analysis and visualisation of proteomic and transcriptomic data.  
These scripts were applied to investigate and visualise changes in the haemolymph proteome of bumblebee queens throughout the queen life-cycle.  
This research was funded by [Science Foundation Ireland](http://www.sfi.ie/) as part of a grant awarded to [Mark Brown at Royal Holloway University of London, UK](https://www.markjfbrown.com/) with this specific study designed and performed in collaboration with [James Carolan at Maynooth University, Ireland](https://crawliomics.com/).  

The results of which are documented in a manuscript currently in review:  
<i>Mating induces selective immune priming which is maintained throughout bumblebee queen diapause.</i>

For the transcriptomic analysis, scripts have been obtained and modified from:  
https://github.com/wurmlab/Bter_neonicotinoid_exposure_experiment  
Reuse of these script requires publication of modified scripts, as well as the citation of the following [paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mec.15047).
