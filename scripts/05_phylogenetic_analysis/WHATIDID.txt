## BLASTP alignment was performed for XP_003393186.2 against the NCBI nr database.
## A number of alignment sequences were downloaded from the resulting batch including
## homologous protein sequences for both bumblebees, other bees, wasps and ants.
## The header information was editted manually to include:
## 1) Abbreviated species name
## 2) Protein ID
## 3) Gene symbol from NCBI

mkdir data
cd data

## Renamed file editted in Atom was saved here.
## Alignment, filtering of alignment and generation of tree was performed using phylogeny.fr
## http://www.phylogeny.fr/
## Alignment was performed using muscle with 'full mode' parameter.
## Curation of alignment was performed using Gblocks with more stringent selection parameter:
## Do not allow many contiguous nonconserved positions - ticked.
## Phylogenetic analysis was performed using PhyML using:
## A bootstrap procedure: Number of bootstraps = 100
## Substitution model = Jones-Taylor-Thornton matrix (protein)
## Tree rendering was performing using TreeDyn.
## This generates a tree editting interface. 

## For plotting, a file can be generated containing two columns:
## Column 1: FASTA header
## Column 2: Species name
grep '>' hahp_family_renamed.fasta | sed 's/>//g' > species_list.txt
